*Total Tasks: ~100+ items across all categories*

## 🚨 **CRITICAL WORKFLOW - READ FIRST**

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (MUST DO FIRST)**
1. Fix `config.py` format issue (blocks all imports)
2. Add missing pygame imports (prevents code execution)
3. Resolve duplicate project structure (creates confusion)
4. Fix game loop parameter mismatches (prevents running)
5. Create basic placeholder assets (prevents crashes)

### **Phase 2: Core Infrastructure**
6. Implement error handling and logging
7. Create proper package exports
8. Set up development environment
9. Fix and expand test suite
10. Add input handling system

### **Phase 3: Game Development**
11. Continue with original High Priority items
12. Build core gameplay features
13. Add content and polish

## Notes
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Complete ALL Phase 1 items before any feature development
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The game cannot run until critical fixes are completed
- Focus on getting a minimal working prototype running first
- Use git branches for major feature development
- Regular testing should be done throughout development
- Consider using virtual environment for dependency management

## Quick Start for New Contributors
1. Complete Phase 1 critical fixes
2. Run `python src/infinite_tower/main.py` to verify basic functionality
3. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
4. Choose items from Phase 2 or 3 based on expertise
