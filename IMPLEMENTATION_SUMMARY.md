## 📝 **ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS**

### Modular Design
Each system is independent and can be tested/modified separately:
- **Entities** (player, enemy) - Game objects
- **Systems** (combat, physics, AI) - Core mechanics
- **Engine** (scene, scheduler, loop) - Framework
- **UI** (HUD, menus) - User interface
- **Floors** (generator) - Level creation
- **Items** (loot) - Item management

### Scalability
All systems are designed to easily add:
- New enemy types
- New item types and rarities
- New room types
- New AI behaviors
- New damage types
- New status effects

### Performance
- Spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection
- Entity pooling ready for implementation
- Delta time for frame-rate independence
- Optimized rendering pipeline ready
