- **File**: `infinite-tower-engine/main.py`
- **Uses**: Async/await pattern for browser compatibility
- **Deploy to**: GitHub Pages for instant web play
- **Perfect for**: Demos, testing, feedback

### 2. 💻 **Desktop Version** (Steam Ready)
- **File**: `infinite-tower-engine/demo_16bit_ui.py`
- **Builds to**: Windows .exe
- **Deploy to**: Steam, itch.io, standalone distribution
- **Perfect for**: Full release, Steam launch

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Test Locally (Both Versions Work!)
```bash
# Desktop version (traditional)
cd infinite-tower-engine
python demo_16bit_ui.py

# Web version (async - what you just ran!)
cd infinite-tower-engine
python main.py
```

### Build for Web (GitHub Pages)
```bash
# Install pygbag first
pip install pygbag

# Option 1: Use our build script
python build_web.py

# Option 2: Manual pygbag
python -m pygbag --build infinite-tower-engine
# Then serve: python -m pygbag infinite-tower-engine
```

### Build for Desktop (Windows EXE)
```bash
# Install pyinstaller first
pip install pyinstaller

# Use our build script
python build_desktop.py

# Output: infinite-tower-engine/dist/InfiniteTower.exe
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture:

- **Web Entry**: `main.py` (async loop)
- **Desktop Entry**: `demo_16bit_ui.py` (standard loop)

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Web (Pygbag) | Desktop (PyInstaller) |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Loop | async/await | Standard while |
| Audio | Limited | Full support |
| File I/O | Limited | Full support |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |
| Distribution | GitHub Pages | .exe file |
| Installation | None (browser) | Download & run |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Pygbag not found"
```bash
pip install pygbag
```

### "PyInstaller not found"
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Web version won't build
- Check `main.py` uses `async/await`
- Ensure all imports work
- Try: `python -m pygbag --build infinite-tower-engine`

### Desktop build fails
- Check all dependencies installed
- Make sure you're in `infinite-tower-engine` directory
- Try running `demo_16bit_ui.py` first to verify it works
